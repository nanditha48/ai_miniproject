This was my mini project for the subject Artificial Intelligence.

In this project we classify the cancer type (benign or malignant) based on neural networks. The neural network we build is using Tensorflow and Keras. Furthermore, we predict the model accuracy and loss. Our model at the end predicts the type of cancer when given with a set of features(input) thereby giving accurate results.
