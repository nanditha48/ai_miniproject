# Breast Cancer Detection Neural Network

This repository contains code for a breast cancer detection neural network trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

The neural network is designed to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies.

## Dependencies

- `numpy` for mathematical operations
- `pandas` for handling data in tabular form
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for dataset loading and preprocessing
- `tensorflow` and `keras` for building and training the neural network

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
